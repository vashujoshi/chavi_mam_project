Vitamin C plays a critical role in tissue growth, repair, and overall immune support. It promotes wound healing and maintains healthy bones, teeth, and skin. Acting as a powerful antioxidant, Vitamin C fights free radicals, which can prevent or delay the onset of chronic diseases such as cancer and heart disease, while also promoting healthy aging."
