        "<strong>Metformin</strong>: Metformin is often the first-line medication for managing Type 2 diabetes. It works by reducing glucose production in the liver and may help with weight management. It’s affordable, safe, and effective at lowering A1C levels and reducing the risk of cardiovascular events.",
        "<strong>Sulfonylureas</strong>: Drugs like glipizide, glyburide, and glimepiride fall into this category. These are cost-effective but may cause weight gain and low blood sugar episodes.",
        "<strong>Insulin Sensitizers</strong>: Pioglitazone, an insulin sensitizer, reduces blood sugar without causing hypoglycemia but can lead to weight gain.",
        "<strong>GLP-1 Receptor Agonists</strong>: Medications like exenatide, liraglutide, and dulaglutide are effective for managing blood sugar, promoting weight loss, and benefiting cardiovascular health. They may, however, cause nausea or diarrhea.",
        "<strong>DPP-4 Inhibitors</strong>: Sitagliptin, saxagliptin, and linagliptin are oral medications that are easy to take, reduce post-meal blood sugar levels, and are generally well-tolerated.",
        "<strong>SGLT-2 Inhibitors</strong>: Drugs like empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and canagliflozin lower blood sugar by promoting glucose excretion through urine. They offer heart and kidney benefits but can increase the risk of urinary tract infections.",
        "<strong>Alpha-glucosidase Inhibitors</strong>: Acarbose, though less commonly used, slows the absorption of carbohydrates but often causes side effects like gas."
