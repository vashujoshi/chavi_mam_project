Each woman’s body operates in a unique rhythm, but the menstrual cycle's four phases—menstrual, follicular, ovulatory, and luteal—are consistent for everyone. By understanding these phases, you can optimize your diet, exercise, and self-care to align with hormonal fluctuations, improve energy, reduce discomfort, and boost productivity."
